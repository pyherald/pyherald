## PEP 768 – Safe external debugger interface for CPython

_[src](https://peps.python.org/pep-0768/), This PEP proposes adding a zero-overhead debugging interface to CPython that allows debuggers and profilers to safely attach to running Python processes. The interface provides safe execution points for attaching debugger code without modifying the interpreter’s normal execution path or adding runtime overhead._

<br>

_A key application of this interface will be enabling pdb to attach to live processes by process ID, similar to gdb -p, allowing developers to inspect and debug Python applications interactively in real-time without stopping or restarting them._
